# raredisease
Welcome to this data journalism project! 🥳

This project is a self-developed and coded data journalism piece that combines **dynamic visualization** with **in-depth reporting** to bring to light the situation of rare diseases, much like an iceberg. You can view the output of this project at https://ljune1999.github.io/raredisease/.

I am thrilled to announce that this project was：

▪ Awarded first prize 🥇 (out of 800 teams) in the 6th China Data Journalism Competition.（http://www.cdjcow.com/show.asp?id=1186）

▪ As well as a nomination in the 2021 China Data Content Competition. （https://awards.data-viz.cn/2021/view/prize.html）

Additionally, I am honored to have been invited by Professor Chengjun Wang（@chengjun）at Nanjing University's School of Journalism and Communication to share and present this project in his undergraduate data journalism course.（https://github.com/data-journalism/data-journalism.github.io/discussions/90）
